Artist Match Memory Game
Inspired by my time spend earning a BFA and “learning slides.” I originally envisioned it being less visual and more of a learning tool.

A simple memory game developed in vanilla javascript with the subtle minty hint of jQuery.

I used Dom manipulation to dynamicallyly generate the game.

My biggest challenges in creating this were creating the Image arrays, so that I passed back the image values. I struggled mightily figuring out the best way to not only show images, but also pass the attribute back to the app to write the logic.

I thought it would be as simple as just creating an image array with src property, but it wouldn’t render. 

Unsolved problems first click gives me the not a match error.
Would love to have a more dynamic database of images. Currently it is hard coded to only show the same 8 image over and over.
